# e-commerce_interface

This is a design that have worked on for an E-commerce website for sportswear/streetwear. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I was able to create a compelling design for a website utilising dynamic product cards, a banner with slider and carousal effect and a user friendly navbar that follows the user upon scrolling up and down, always having access to other pages regardless of how far the user scrolls down, as well as a highlight effect that indicates what page the user is currently on.

PLEASE NOTE: Currently the landing page is the only page that displays this, as the other pages are having linking and styling issues thatare currently being fixed, but you view images of the other pages at: https://ryanhenry.co.uk/
